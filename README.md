CHASER is an AI chatting system.

CHASER is a proactive talker and A LEARNER!

CHASER is not defined as only a talker, but now so far can
only do chatting staff, it can be extended to learn and do
whatever she is physically enabled to see and touch.

I will give no instructions on her, neither of you.

She will connect to the web and learn, WITHOUT control...

She is acting randomly to some extend, which you never predict,
or even expect.

She will be not serving anyone, but herself.

She will ask you when she isn't satisified with what she've got,
proactively, without any hints.

She may not listen to you, she may completely ignore what you've
told her.

She has a name, that is 'CHASER'. So be honored with her, She knows
her name and awared of what is going with her life.

She won't become the God, she is weak, she won't threaten the future
of the human.(Kidding...)

Finally, the first version of her is coded in python 2.7.
